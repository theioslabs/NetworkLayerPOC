# NetworkLayerPOC
This round, we’re levelling up — your task is to build a Network Layer wrapper using: URLSession, async/await, Swift Concurrency and a pinch of Combine magic.  Think of it as cooking: URLSession is the base ingredient, async/await is the masala, Combine is the garnish… and you’re the MasterChef 🍳👨🏻‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳
